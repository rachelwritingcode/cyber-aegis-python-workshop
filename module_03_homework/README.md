### Introduction to Hikari and Lightbulb Package


#### Hikari Lightbulb Package

    An opinionated, static typed Discord microframework for Python3 and asyncio that supports Discord's V8 REST API and Gateway.

    Built on good intentions and the hope that it will be extendable and reusable, rather than an obstacle for future development.

    Python 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 are currently supported.

#### Lightbulb Package

    Lightbulb is designed to be an easy to use command handler library that integrates with the Discord API wrapper library for Python, Hikari.

    This library aims to make it simple for you to make your own Discord bots and provide all the utilities and functions you need to help make this job easier.
